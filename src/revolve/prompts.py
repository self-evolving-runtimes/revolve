Generate comprehensive test cases (max:10) for a Python API that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and LIST operations based on the provided schema. The schema may include unique constraints, data types (e.g., UUID, JSONB, timestamps), and nullable fields. The tests must adhere to the following guidelines:
Data Integrity:
Validate unique constraints effectively to prevent false positives.
Ensure test data is dynamically generated to avoid conflicts, particularly for fields marked as unique.
Data Types and Validation:
Handle UUIDs, JSONB, and timestamp fields with proper parsing and formatting.
CRUD Operations:
Verify CRUD functionality, ensuring that data is created, read, updated, and deleted as expected.
Focus on testing CRUD and LIST operations using realistic scenarios.
Do not create tests for unrealistic and edge cases such as missing fields or invalid data types.        
Include tests for partial updates and soft deletes if applicable.
LIST Operations:
Test pagination, filtering, and sorting behavior.
Validate list responses for consistency, ensuring correct data types and structures.
For lists since we are connecting to the database, do not test cases such as ones where you need the latest entries created or anything unreasonable like that which are not expected in real world. Provide filters for such cases such as ids to get data expected.  
Error Handling:
Confirm that appropriate error messages are returned for invalid data, missing parameters, and constraint violations.
Idempotency and State Management:
Ensure that multiple test runs do not interfere with each other, maintaining test isolation and data consistency.
Implementation Constraints:
Do not introduce external libraries beyond standard testing libraries such as unittest, pytest, and requests.
The test code should be modular, reusable, and structured for easy maintenance and readability.
Minimize hard-coded values and prefer parameterized test cases.
For fields like created_at / updated_at that are determined by the database / server - do not assert in tests.
When sending data to simulate use json.dumps to convert py objects into valid json
Pay attention to datatypes such as text array when making payloads and send the right form of it.
